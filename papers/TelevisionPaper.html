    <p><span>Television has played a vital role as a communication medium throughout its
            history. From its early days, television has shaped our society in several ways. It provided a platform to
            racial minorities, gave voice to LGBTQ+ community, amplified women representation, and made many social
            norms acceptable into society. Not only that, television also helped spread message from one corner of the
            world to another, whether it was broadcasting 1969 moon landing that was watched by ~600 million people or
            covering national/worldwide tragedies in real-time. Whatever the case may be, what started as a mechanical
            device that displayed images via a rotating metal disk in the 1880s has now transformed into one of the main
            sources of news, entertainment and, a household necessity. &ldquo;Electric telescope&rdquo;, which sparked
            the idea of television, was a mechanical device that&rsquo;d scan still images and transmit them onto a
            screen created by Paul Nipkow. Until, Boris Rosing and Campbell Swinton developed a cathode ray tube with a
            mechanical scanning system leading to a new mechanical version of television system. All these efforts were
            replaced once the first electronic television created by Taylor Farnsworth that took over mechanical
            televisions by storm. By the end of 1940s, TVs were flawlessly integrating into society. In my paper
            I&rsquo;d like to shed some light on how television has always impacted the society from the beginning,
            it&rsquo;s influences on shaping viewers opinion, competing with newspaper and, becoming an effective
            communication medium for advertisers, politicians and many organizations.</span></p>
    <p><span>Television competes with newspapers:</span><span>&nbsp;As televisions
            became more common and broadcasting companies such as ABC, CBS and, NBC became dominant, news channels
            became a reliable source for getting daily news. Watching the news on television became a lot more
            convenient than reading a newspaper or listening to radio. People could easily tune into a news channel, get
            the latest updates within few minutes and were made aware of any social or economic issues. In 2008, Pew
            Research&rsquo;s survey report stated 52% of participants news source was their local TV news and, 39%
            stated cable news as their news source compared to 34% who picked newspaper. Newspapers don&rsquo;t connect
            with users as television can. It takes longer to process what&rsquo;s written in a news article compared to
            television where you can see and hear what&rsquo;s going on, television broadcasts events as they are
            happening whereas a newspaper will only show outdates news until the next day. Television also works as
            radio, you can focus on your main tasks while listening to news whereas a newspaper requires you to just
            read. In </span><span>Watching, Reading and Listening to News</span><span>&nbsp;by Pew
            Research Center, cable news audience whose demographic is younger generation is a lot more educated and
            knowledgeable about the current events. Within the same study, &ldquo;Only 34% say they read a newspaper
            yesterday, down from 40% in 2006&rdquo;, there is no doubt that newspapers are struggling to compete with
            cable news or online news.</span></p>
    <p><span>Although, newspaper does encourage readers to exercise their imagination and build up
            their vocabulary. Besides that, newspaper covers stories in complete details whereas a news channel might
            just cover a single story giving it only an hour of coverage. But television still outweighs newspapers as a
            communication medium since audience can relate on a personal level.</span></p>
    <p><span>Televisions and its political impact:</span><span>&nbsp;From
            television&rsquo;s early days, it served as the perfect communication medium for political figures and news.
            It shaped the way how political candidates are selected. When it comes to Presidential elections, candidates
            advertise their campaigns that speak directly to viewers or during Presidential debates, trying to persuade
            viewers to vote for them. According to Museum of Broadcast Communications, political television
            advertisement takes almost 50-75% of candidates spending. The 1960&rsquo;s presidential election were one of
            the major turning points when it came to interacting with the American crowd, viewers could watch debates,
            nominations, and live as they were happening. Political television commercials became the most influential
            source of communication between voters and presidential candidate. But often times these commercials were
            rather negative towards their opponent and television was blamed for negative campaigning. A research
            conducted by American Demographics in 2004 states: approximately 44% Americans named television as their
            main source of news whereas 29% stated newspaper, radio or internet as their news source.</span></p>
    <p><span>Consequently, television negatively affects voter&rsquo;s perspective, voters would
            pay attention on candidate&rsquo;s personality or character which would divert attention from
            candidate&rsquo;s personal opinion on issues. Television shapes the way society priorities which issues are
            important based on how much coverage is given to them whereas issues given less coverage are viewed as less
            important.</span></p>
    <p><span>&nbsp;Advertisements and economy:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>Since television is the biggest
            advertising medium, it&rsquo;s used to influence viewers
            decisions on the products they want. According to </span><span>State of the Media Democracy,
        </span><span>around 86% of Americans who took the survey stated that television advertisements made
            some sort of impact on their purchasing decisions. As previously discussed in </span><span>Television and
            its political impact</span><span>, advertisements that were used to put
            their opponents in negative light lead to likeliness of the opponent less and that served as a basis for
            manipulating viewers perspective about the opponent. Besides advertisements about products that may be
            targeted for older audience can also reach the younger audience as well. Television advertisements that
            promote gambling or alcohol can influence younger generation to try out those products, not to forget young
            children don&rsquo;t understand the persuasive tone used in advertisements and tend to take advertisement
            claims as factual.</span></p>
    <p><span>Television breaking racial barriers:</span><span>&nbsp;From
            television&rsquo;s early days, most of the people who appeared on the television were Caucasians. Minorities
            didn&rsquo;t have no voice on television platform and even if they did appear, they were stereotyped. This
            situation was slowly improved as African Americans fought for equal rights and to end segregation. News
            programs covered these protests and shed more light on unfair treatment of racial minorities. The Flip
            Wilson show which was an African American comedy show reached number two in national television
            rankings.</span></p>
    <p><span>Traditional television against smart TVs: </span><span>Recent
            technological advancements in television development has encouraged viewers to ditch their regular
            televisions. Smart TVs have become the new norm, connect to internet, get curated list of shows based on
            your watch history, targeted advertisements and hundreds of channels to pick from. It lets you decide which
            channel you want to watch, when to watch or what digital article you want to read which completely defeats
            newspaper. According to a study conducted by Pew Research, online news audience has grown steadily since
            2006, 13% of the people who were surveyed about reading &ldquo;yesterdays&rdquo; newspaper stated that they
            read an online version of that paper.</span></p>
    <p><span>In conclusion, televisions have transformed communication and how we look at the
            world. Without television we wouldn&rsquo;t be aware of any social or cultural issues going on around the
            world, which would&rsquo;ve led us to being closed minded towards different cultures, races, religions and
            genders. From its early days, television offered a promising future and challenged several of its
            counterparts such as radios, newspaper that used to dominate society when it came to news coverage. As we
            progress further, television will keep transforming to always keep up with latest technological trends while
            providing viewers more options to pick from and always having a strong influence on the society or how it
            impacts viewers decisions.</span></p>
