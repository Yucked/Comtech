        <p><span>Throughout history, advertisements have been used to manipulate our minds and
                        give
                        us a better understanding of the world we live in. As we know, as time passed the communication
                        medium of
                        advertisement also advanced to a great extent. &nbsp;It not only changes people&#39;s point of
                        view but also
                        affects the way they communicate. It acts as both an informative and motivational media. Like
                        other forms of
                        communication, advertisement also has benefits and destructive effects on people. The
                        advancement of
                        advertisement is extremely beneficial for us, such as it helps us send off information from
                        different parts
                        of the world to keep others informed about what is going on at the surrounding places. It allows
                        us to
                        convince others to be a part of the various movements that are going on at places not only
                        closest to them
                        but also globally. Advertisement has a powerful negative effect on people especially on the
                        adolescent
                        population who often lacks better judgment, which is the method of promoting addiction and usage
                        of tobacco
                        and alcohol without reaching the legal age. Although, the purpose of an advertisement is not
                        necessarily to
                        encourage addiction, however, it is a downside that automatically comes with it. </span></p>
        <p><span>One of the vital aspects of advertisement is its ability to endorse addiction
                        and
                        the use of tobacco and alcohol. As mentioned earlier that none of the advertisements&rsquo; goal
                        is to
                        encourage such behavior but it is a side effect that comes with it. Advertisement has been known
                        to promote
                        these behaviors in all age groups, especially among adolescents. One of the large issues that
                        teenagers
                        often come across is the use of tobacco without reaching the legal age. Similar to many
                        countries, in the
                        United States, the legal age to purchase tobacco products is 18 years as well. However, with the
                        growth in
                        e-cigarette commercials, many teenagers often start to use tobacco products without reaching 18
                        years.
                        Professor Camenga along with his peers conducted a study where they examined whether exposure to
                        e-cigarette
                        advertisement in television, social media, retail stores, and other media associated with the
                        use of
                        e-cigarettes in adolescents. They used high school teenagers from different ethnicities who did
                        not have a
                        history of using e-cigarettes. After the study, they came to the conclusion that the
                        advertisement of
                        tobacco indeed increases the likelihood of subsequent e-cigarette use (79-82). Another similar
                        study
                        conducted by Dr. Singh and his peers produced a similar result where they concluded that greater
                        exposure to
                        e-cigarette advertisements can lead to higher odds of use in not only high school students but
                        also in
                        middle schoolers (3, 5-6). Both studies also mentioned that advertisements often skip or
                        fast-forward over
                        the side-effects which is a reason why teenagers don&rsquo;t get to understand them clearly. As
                        the young
                        age, teenagers often lack the ability to make better judgments, which is another reason why they
                        naively
                        become influenced by the advertisements and demonstrates the higher likelihood of using this
                        harmful
                        substance. </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, video games and online
                        gambling sites have become popular. One might easily stumble on these entertainments&rsquo; ads
                        on social
                        networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. Since most of the teenage
                        population
                        spends a majority of their time on these social media websites, therefore, it is often easier
                        for them to
                        get involved with these entertainment methods. Even though many of these games might seem
                        harmless, however,
                        they generally lead to addiction. A study by O&rsquo;Loughlin suggests that ads posted by
                        gambling operators
                        have a great effect on teenagers because they are often subject to fewer regulations when posted
                        on social
                        networking websites (314). Traditional media advertisements are heavily regulated, for example,
                        &quot;in
                        Australia, the Broadcast Industry Code prohibits the discussion of live odds during sports
                        matches on
                        television and radio.&quot; However, because of the absence of regulations in social media
                        outlets, gambling
                        operators can easily post any ads about their products to convince people especially adolescents
                        to become a
                        part of it (O&rsquo;Loughlin 315). Similar to the study of O&rsquo;Loughlin, Samantha L. Thomas
                        depicted
                        identical outcomes. Both studies concluded that further regulatory systems are required and
                        should be
                        enforced in both traditional media and social media websites in order to prevent gambling
                        operators from
                        broadcasting attractive message to young teenagers which often lead to an expansion of gambling
                        intention
                        among them. </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisements about alcohol and
                        fast-food are leading teenagers to start drinking without reaching their proper age and eating
                        unhealthy
                        food without knowing the risk factors. Alcohol use leads to serious health concerns, violence,
                        self-inflicted injuries, risky sexual behaviors, and mental health disorders (Dumbili 74). Most
                        young people
                        are unaware of these risk factors and continue consumption. Numerous evidence proved that one of
                        the factors
                        that encourage alcohol consumption is alcohol marketing. The reviews of longitudinal studies,
                        alcohol
                        advertisements not only increase alcohol use but also influences the frequency and quantity of
                        alcohol usage
                        by adolescents. Thus proving the fact that, this influence results from the fact that alcohol
                        advertisements
                        portray the benefit of alcohol usages &nbsp;(75-76). Similarly, food commercials can lead to
                        many health
                        benefits among teenagers. Fast-food stores often portray luring images and deals on items that
                        are not
                        healthy and can lead to obesity and other health problems. Also, on social media websites,
                        people tend to
                        share their food pictures which are mostly high in calories and low in nutrients (Holmberg 122).
                        Both the
                        alcohol and food commercials highlight the benefits of their products which attract young
                        people. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisement promoting addiction
                        has
                        a strong effect on interpersonal communication. One of the main effects is, it makes people
                        become
                        segregated from their friends, family, and society. As mentioned earlier, it promotes gaming and
                        gambling
                        addiction among not only teenagers but also in adults. If one becomes addicted to such
                        entertainments, then
                        one automatically becomes segregated from their surroundings. Their life becomes limited to the
                        virtual
                        people among the games. &nbsp;Another significant impact of advertisement is it leads to
                        peer-pressure and
                        bullying. Numerous studies showed that teenagers often become addicted to games due to
                        peer-pressure
                        (O&rsquo;Loughlin 315). Peer-pressure also leads to smoking and alcohol usage. Bullying can
                        result from the
                        obesity that one might face due to fast-food addiction which is an ultimate result of fast-food
                        commercials.
                </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among with other impacts of
                        advertisement, one is its ability to persuade people to think in certain ways they would not
                        normally do.
                        One method of advertisement is propaganda that was vastly used during war times. War times
                        always creates a
                        need for soldiers in all countries. Most countries came with the solution to use propaganda to
                        encourage
                        young men to join the army. Radio was also involved in this process. It was &ldquo;an important
                        means of
                        psychological strategy and political propaganda used by both sides&rdquo; (Sim&aacute;ndi 105).
                        During war
                        times, nations used both of these advertisements to remind people of the struggle their
                        countries were
                        facing where they needed the support of its citizens. They also emotionally persuaded people to
                        join the
                        army to make themselves portray as heroes which the ads claimed to show. </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisements have the ability
                        to
                        make people even change their religious belief, also it can use religion to influence people to
                        do
                        something. The use of propaganda was first used in Europe to invite people to convert to
                        Christianity. Even
                        now, people distribute pamphlets which provide information about different religions to
                        encourage others to
                        become a part of it. In health care systems, people started to use ads with religious symbols to
                        encourage
                        people to start caring for themselves. For instance, a study monitoring African American
                        women&rsquo;s
                        eagerness to participate in breast cancer screening if they come across an ad of the screening
                        with a sacred
                        symbol (Lumpkins 182). The study concluded that although the act of going to church variable has
                        a
                        significant effect, yet it showed that a sacred symbol indeed serves as a persuasive aspect for
                        African
                        American women to have breast cancer screening. The most common use of advertisements is it
                        persuades people
                        to buy things such as electronics, food, household items, beauty products, and many other
                        products. For
                        instance, Apple Computer&#39;s 1984 advertisement was considered an advertising legend because
                        it caused
                        more than 200,000 people to stand in line waiting for store doors to open (Scott 68). People
                        often become
                        influenced to buy products based on traditional TV advertising, along with traditional retail
                        stores, and
                        website advertising. This persuasive power of ads leads to an increase in sales which are
                        extremely
                        beneficial for the economy.</span></p>
        <p><span>Advertisement&#39;s ability to persuade people have an effect on their
                        interpersonal communication. When one becomes influenced by someone or something, one feels the
                        urge to
                        share that with someone else and often tries to persuade others to repeat it. For instance, if a
                        young man
                        joins the army during war times, he will feel the urge to influence his peers to join the army
                        as well.
                        Similarly, people from one religion desire to persuade other people to join their religion.
                        Likewise, when
                        one becomes persuaded to buy something from an advertisement, then he or she might try to make
                        their fellow
                        people buy the same products. This persuasive aspect of advertisement does not always affect
                        people
                        positively, it also has a negative effect of causing bullying and peer-pressure. As mentioned
                        earlier,
                        peer-pressure can lead to addiction, and the use of tobacco and alcohol, however, peer-pressure
                        and bullying
                        can also make people buy or do things they do not feel comfortable doing. This is can harm
                        people mentally,
                        emotionally, and physically as well. </span></p>
        <p><span>Ads are a channel of getting information for many people. It provides valuable
                        information that aids people in their daily livelihood. There are numerous software and apps
                        being developed
                        in a fairly short amount of time currently. The main way for the developers to grab the
                        consumers&rsquo;
                        attention is to promote their products through advertisements. They often post ads about their
                        products as
                        online advertisements on social media websites, and other platforms such as Google AdWords
                        (&ldquo;The
                        History of Advertising&rdquo;). These advertisements often include the services and protection
                        that the
                        products will provide. For instance, an ad of Avast the antivirus application can include
                        information about
                        the malware, web scripting, boot sector, directory, and other forms of viruses that the
                        application can
                        protect against. Many consumers may not have knowledge about these forms of viruses before
                        seeing the ad.
                </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with information about
                        products
                        and services, advertisements also provide information about politics. They inform about
                        different elections
                        and the candidates. As we know, swing states are significant in the presidential elections.
                        Hence, during
                        the presidential campaign, candidates tend to inundate voters in swing states with political ads
                        (Konitzer
                        10). These ads often include the agendas of the candidates. It educates people about reforms or
                        harm that
                        the politicians are causing to the citizens and to the environment as well. Before a candidate
                        is elected,
                        he or she advertises about the reforms he or she plans to conduct, such as environmental
                        protection
                        improvements, affordable healthcare, and many other aspects that the citizens suffer through.
                        Based on
                        information from these advertisements citizens choose which candidate will best represent them.
                        Political
                        advertisements not only reveal the positive elements of a candidate, but they also reveal the
                        negative
                        aspects which the citizens might not agree upon. Then, people can compare between the
                        candidates, and their
                        agendas to vote on the best candidate to represent them. The power of advertisement helps
                        citizens to select
                        the ideal candidate for them.</span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisement has an immense
                        effect
                        on the economy. It leads to an increase in the sale of products and services which results in
                        economic
                        growth. Nowadays, whenever people produce something, they almost always invest in ads to promote
                        their
                        products and often it seems that better the ads result in greater sales. Due to the advances in
                        technology,
                        people can put advertisements on social media and other websites that grab the attention of
                        people
                        worldwide. Needls is an ad platform which developed the internet&rsquo;s first RoboAgency that
                        automatically
                        develops, targets, and optimizes digital ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat that can
                        benefit small
                        business owners. They monitor social media conversations in real time to provide people with ads
                        relevant to
                        them at the time of their need, making it effortless for the consumers. Similar to the
                        newspaper, ads also
                        provide information about economic downfalls and improvements. Most of these types of ads are
                        shown through
                        online newspapers which want people to stay informed about the economy and prepare for the
                        consequences it
                        might cause on them. </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ads as a method of information
                        provider have a powerful effect on people&rsquo;s interpersonal communication. Much like
                        persuading others,
                        people often become eager to share the knowledge they gathered from advertisements with others.
                        For
                        instance, people most definitely discussed among each other about the economic collapse they
                        faced during
                        the Great Depression. Through these discussions, they shared their knowledge and gained
                        understanding about
                        each other&#39;s situations as well. This is another benefit of advertisement, which is its
                        ability to
                        promote cultural, situational, psychological understanding among people. Without advertisements,
                        people
                        might not learn about other cultures or religion. Without it, people might not know about the
                        soldier crisis
                        during war times. Also, without it, people might never learn about some great inventions.
                </span></p>
        <p><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisements have numerous
                        positive
                        and negative effects on people. The addiction problem is particularly serious since it mostly
                        occurs in
                        teenagers who are the future of the world. Even, though there are ads which are introducing and
                        promoting
                        such addictive products, yet there are also ads which are warning about the risk factors. The
                        persuasive and
                        informative powers of ads made people know about and start using some great innovations of
                        history including
                        electricity, telephone, cellphones, and many more. These powers make people have understanding
                        and
                        compassion among one another. They provide knowledge, however, knowledge comes with
                        responsibility. Some
                        people use it to bully others, and some use it to simply share it among their peers.
                </span><span class="c0">As the technology has been enhancing over time, so is advertisements. There was
                        a time when
                        advertisements were only paper based, however with the growth of technology, advertisements are
                        also
                        growthing and making their existence in online websites, and social medias. From this, it can be
                        predicted
                        that there will be a time in the future when advertisements are automatically being generated as
                        the human
                        minds are visualizing them.</span></p>
