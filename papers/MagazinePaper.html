    <p><span>The magazine is one of the most popular forms of print media around the world.
            Looking towards the history of magazines, it provides us important perspectives about this medium. Although
            magazines play a positive role in interpersonal communication among people, it also has some negative
            impacts on people&rsquo;s daily life and social interactions. After extensive research on the subject of
            communication media, I selected magazine as my research topic upon interpersonal communication. In this
            project, I propose to address three major issues associated with the magazine medium, which includes the
            competition between print magazines and digital magazines upon interpersonal communication; the influence on
            body image perception from magazines; and the educative values of magazines.</span></p>
    <p><span>Competitions between print magazine and digital magazine. </span><span>The
            innovations of digital technology have revolutionized traditional media, such as television, radio,
            newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and other print publications. In the context of digitalization, the rise
            of digital magazines has become one of the biggest challenges against print magazines. However, digital
            magazines and print magazines have their distinct advantages upon the topic of interpersonal communication.
            Looking towards the advantages of digital magazines, the convenience and accessibility of digital magazine
            enable it to reach a broader range of readers geographically. This distinct advantage of digital magazine
            ensures that the information (in magazines) distributed globally, and further promotes interpersonal
            communication among people upon their reading interest. For example, digital political magazines are able to
            introduce political topics or controversies to people from all around the world. The digital distributions
            of political magazines not only encourage more general public to get involve and participate in political
            activities (such as, elections), but also creates a bigger open discussion among policymakers and general
            people on some political issues. In this case, policymakers are able to better understand people&rsquo;s
            opinions and so make laws and rules which are better to protect their legal rights and resolve disputes
            equally (Seoane 5). Besides, digital magazines promote more instantly and directly interpersonal
            communications (such as, instant comments-and-feedbacks) between readers and publishers than print
            magazines. For example, the interactive content in digital magazines (such as, live streaming) gives
            publishers the ability to communicate with their readers directly, without having to print the content and
            distribute it through different distribution channels (Marshak 1).</span></p>
    <p><span>Aside from the advantages of digital magazines, print magazines also have very
            distinct advantages on interpersonal communication. The haptic communication (a type of communication
            through a sense of touch) in print magazines strengthens readership between readers and print magazines
            (Dillion 1). Unlike digital magazines, print magazines contain tactile elements, which creates physical
            interaction between readers and the papers (of the magazines). Bonner and Chris conducted a study to explore
            how Millennials feel about print magazines in the Internet age (Bonner 1). In this study, they found that
            &ldquo;73% of participants acknowledging that they read magazines. Furthermore, 46% of magazine-reading
            respondents reported print as their magazine format preferences.&rdquo; (8). &nbsp;Besides, they found that
            the key reason why print magazine is the preference of those participants is the print&rsquo;s physical
            attributes, which are that &ldquo;participants seemed to want a physical product they could hold&rdquo; and
            print magazine &ldquo;made them more likely to read the stories, comprehend the content, and retain the
            information&rdquo; (6-7). &nbsp;Unlike print magazines, digital magazines lack this important element.
            Abrahamson mentioned that the magazine industries try to mimic the tactility and portability of printed
            paper to satisfy readers&rsquo; need and preference on haptic communication in papers while embracing the
            influence from digitalization (2).</span></p>
    <p><span>Magazine Influence on body image perception. </span><span>Fashion and
            Beauty magazines are one of the most popular types of magazine, which focus on delivering latest fashion and
            beauty information (such as, beauty standards, treading clothing and pop stars) to readers. However, some
            studies have shown that fashion and beauty magazines have a negative relationship with body image
            dissatisfaction and psychological health among men (Swiatkowski 1). Swiatkowski mentioned that the
            &ldquo;Skinny idea&rdquo; established by the fashion and beauty magazines also have a negative effect on
            women&rsquo;s health and behavior (3). From their studies towards the magazine influence on women&rsquo;s
            body dissatisfaction, they found that &ldquo;fashion magazines were significantly and positively correlated
            with body dissatisfaction.&rdquo; and &ldquo;level of commitment to both fashion magazines (r (224) = 0.139,
            p = 0.038) and health magazines (r (224) = 0.144, p = 0.032) are significantly and positively correlated
            with body dissatisfaction, suggesting that the more committed the participant is to that type of magazine,
            the higher the body dissatisfaction.&rdquo; (9). Moreover, Holmstrom conducted a meta-analysis on exploring
            the relationship between media and body image (196). He found that &ldquo;women who report viewing media for
            longer periods of time also report greater body satisfaction. These women may be engaging in social
            comparison processes that enhance their view of their bodies&rdquo; (214). All the evidence above has
            strongly suggested that fashion magazine have a negative impact on body image perception among
            people.</span></p>
    <p><span>This unrealistic beauty standard and body image perception which are created by
            fashion and beauty magazines, not only create unrealistic expectations for young men and women but also
            results in body dissatisfaction, and more importantly increase health risks (such as disordered eating)
            among people. Additionally, these social pressures and body dissatisfaction created by fashion magazines
            greatly encourage people to pursue an idealized body. In order to build a perfect body image, many women
            unwisely go on a diet to look skinny without considering their own health conditions, which unfortunately
            lead them to eating disorders. Tiggemann investigated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and
            disordered eating through conducting a cross-cultural research study among Australia and Italian women. He
            also examined the role of fashion magazines and clothes to these participants. She found that &ldquo;the
            frequency of fashion magazine reading was associated with internalization and awareness of the thin ideal
            for both Australian and Italian samples&rdquo;. Moreover, she observed that the positive relationship
            between reading fashion magazines and disordered eating from the Australian sample (298).</span></p>
    <p><span>Fashion magazines have been criticized for its negative impact on body image
            perception as well as people&rsquo;s psychological and physical health. After receiving the social needs and
            pressure of establishing a healthier beauty standard, some fashion magazines have been trying to create a
            more realistic body image for their readers by changing the body image of models in their magazines. These
            magazine publishers apply a wide range of body-sized models in their magazine content rather than only
            skinny-sized models. This change of policy of fashion magazines is the product of interpersonal
            communication between readers and publishers. In this way, it promotes a healthier beauty standard and
            social environment for men and women to pursue their own beauty, and build appropriate body image perception
            for themselves. In addition to the fashion magazine, some clothing stores also change to sell more
            customized sized clothes to meet individual needs for their body size.</span></p>
    <p><span>Educative values of the magazine. </span><span>Abrahamson mentions the
            &ldquo;privilege position&rdquo; of magazines, which is that magazines are &ldquo;more detailed and
            interpretive than newspapers, but somewhat less reflective and comprehensive yet more accessible than
            books&rdquo; (1). For example, this characteristic advantage of magazines make it become an innovative tool
            for classroom teaching among children. Magazines are children friendly as they are full of pictures and
            colors. These types of magazines make knowledge more interesting and easier to understand for younger age
            groups. Besides, some vivid, easy and short-text children&rsquo;s magazines promote children&rsquo;s
            interest in reading and in-class discussions among themselves, which can lead to a positive interaction
            between these young students and teachers as well as the development of student&rsquo;s critical thinking
            skills (Goggin 2).</span></p>
    <p><span>Aside from the children&rsquo;s magazines, college or school magazines also have
            positive impact on high school and college students upon interpersonal communication. High school and
            college are the critical stages in a student&rsquo;s education pathway. And students in these stages need
            guidance and encouragements to pursue their academic achievements and set up career goal. In those college
            and school magazines, students or alumnus are able to share their successful experiences with each other.
            This type of interpersonal communication from reading school and college magazines not only give students
            resources to achieve their academic and career goal, but also inspire and promote positive social
            interaction among themselves. Besides, school magazines also give students more informational resources to
            express their opinions and create wider open discussions on school policies and education systems. They can
            use the school and college magazine as a tool to change the policy if that goes against students benefits in
            education opportunities.</span></p>
    <p><span>Focusing on the educative values of magazines on public health, health and science
            magazines play an important role on spreading health information in a simple and language to general public,
            which encourages a better health outcome among people. Some research-based or scientific papers and journals
            can be so difficult to read and comprehend for general people without certain science background. This
            limitation not only restricts the diversities of readers (only scientists or specialists of certain fields)
            but also restricts interpersonal communication to a narrow range of readers based on their educational
            background. However, in terms of the complexity of the content, magazine is apparently less complex than
            scientific papers and journals, and is more friendly to general people with the use of simple and
            easy-standing language, vivid images as well as more organized structure (Abrahamson 2). With the help of
            these tools, magazines seem to be more successful on catching readers&rsquo; interest and engagements, but
            also promotes diversified interpersonal communication without requirement of certain educational
            background.</span></p>
    <p><span>The three major issues associated with the magazine medium (including the competition
            upon interpersonal communication between print magazines and digital magazines; the influence on body image
            perception from fashion magazines; and the educative values of magazines) has been studied in this article.
            Based on the analysis of magazines upon the topic of interpersonal communication, this article suggests that
            magazines have both negative and positive influence on people&rsquo;s behavior, health and communication.
            Although magazines have important impacts on people&rsquo;s daily life, the development of magazines have
            been challenged. Looking towards the future of magazines, people have different opinions on its development.
            Under the challenges from different communication media and technology revolutions, some people have
            predicted the extinctions or death of the magazine medium. However, I believe that magazines will not die
            and continue surviving along with other print media. Additionally, magazines will evolve into a new form,
            which better adapts to the digital era while keeping its advantages on interpersonal communication. For
            example, magazines will become digitized and more interactive. In this case, people will be able to easily
            read magazines from their phones, tablets or computers. And the interactive contents in digital magazines
            will also make magazines reading experience more memorable and engaging to the readers. Furthermore,
            although print media are changing and declining in the era of digitalization, I believe some publishers will
            find new ways to make print magazines viable. </span></p>
