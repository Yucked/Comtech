    <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic mail, also known as email,
            was introduced in 1965 at MIT and it has since become a major part of human life across the world. Email has
            become one of the most convenient ways to communicate with anyone and anywhere around the world as long as
            both individuals have an email account. &nbsp;An email was first used in the business sector, universities
            and government agencies. It became extremely popular because it was able to send instant messages, while
            traditional mail took a few days to deliver. Today, email is one of those things that almost every
            individual has an account. It has become a large part of people&#39;s&#39; lives. Technology has changed in
            many different ways and there are so many different ways to communicate over the internet. However, email is
            still a very important factor in internet communication systems. There are many different types of email
            systems available for free and most people create multiple accounts for themselves. Although it is an
            amazing &nbsp;piece of technology and makes most people&#39;s lives so much easier to communicate, there are
            always advantages and disadvantages to technology. There are many privacy and security issues people face
            when using email. People receive scam emails that can affect a person financially and emotionally. There are
            others who use emails to send wrong or private information that can affect a person&#39;s lifestyle. Many
            times people use email to bully and harass people over email. Email is one of the oldest communication
            systems and people all around the world still use this system to communicate with each other from anywhere
            or to anywhere within the globe. However, it is a personal responsibility for the individual to be careful
            when using email because of privacy and security reasons, or it could lead to emotional distress.

    <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1990s - 1995 people
            started to have internet at home and services like AOL, Prodigy, and CompuServ were provided. People took an
            interest in the emailing service and they started using it. It became very popular because it was free and
            people were able to communicate instantly. Technology has evolved and email communication also became even
            better. An individual is now able to send an email to anyone around the world. When sending an email it is
            almost instant, in a matter of seconds the email can be send to an entirely different country. &ldquo;Emails
            can be as fast as needed... &nbsp;email disposes of transmission delays imposed by geographical
            distance&rdquo;. Meaning that with traditional mailing an individual may try to send emergency mail across
            the world, but it could be delayed because of natural disasters or issues faced during the shipment of the
            mail. However, email allows people to send that message right away without any type of issues to a different
            country or geographically far. The United States is a country built with immigrants. Most people have
            connections to a family who are from a different origin. Many immigrants who might have migrated from a
            different country are now able to communicate with their family over email for free. Immigrants come to a
            different country to escape from something and build a better life. They often face a financial crisis as
            they are in a new country without a job. Talking to family members internationally cost money and they may
            avoid daily calls to save money. Email allows them to communicate overseas for free. &ldquo;More recently,
            the Internet has started to change the ways in which these groups interact by providing an integrated bridge
            home&hellip;.. the Internet includes the use of video conferencing to communicate with the community of
            origin. The characteristics of the Internet (combining text, image, audio, and video) not only satisfy the
            communication needs of the community . Most immigrants, including people who travel internationally now use
            email to contact family members. Emails also provide built-in chatting system that people use to
            communicate. Although email is not always the popular way to communicate internationally, it is required to
            sign up for other free services that allow those interactive features. An example would be Skype or
            Facebook, they both require an email address to open an account. These things allow those people to not feel
            lonely or isolated from their family. Today, people receive their news differently. Technology has made it
            easier for people to receive news only on what they are interested in. Companies use emails to send
            notification or send a newsletter to inform people.&ldquo;The aim of personalization is to make the message
            more noticeable and persuasive by making it important to an individual...Personalization means creating
            communication in which information about the recipient is used to refer to some aspects of his or her self.
            This allows anyone to receive information from anywhere around the world and not have to search and look for
            the latest information. People use them to gain knowledge or be aware of their surroundings.</span></p>
    <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email is very important in
            professional environments or workplaces. Most people who work in a professional environment are given an
            email address that represents the organization. When using those email addresses, the individual takes
            responsibilities that sometimes they are not aware of. Email is a major communication system that is used in
            the workplace to communicate with colleagues and customers. It is also important for the individual to
            understand that the email is the property of the company. Some people use work email for personal use or
            send confidential information to the wrong person. These actions can lead to an individual to be fired.
            Employees began to discover their email was read by employers. In one case, when an employee of Pillsbury
            sent what he thought was a private email communication to a co-worker labeling Pillsbury as
            &quot;back-stabbing bastards,&quot; he was fired for &quot;inappropriate and unprofessional comments. The
            employee took this issue to court and Philadelphia Federal District Court judge ruled that the company did
            not guarantee their privacy, therefore they are able to look into those emails. This shows that, even though
            email is an important communication system that is being used in the workplace, it is not private and can
            not be used for personal use. This can cause the individual to lose the job and they will not be protected
            by the laws unless any type of promises were made. Companies monitor employees email to check and make sure
            they are not doing personal activities on the company&#39;s time. Getting fired could look extremely bad on
            the persons work history and may affect the person when applying for a new job or building a career. When a
            person speaks to someone face to face, the other person is not only listening but also reading body language
            and facial expression to understand the mood of the person. These are very important because we understand
            if the person is happy or angry. When an email is sent, the reader interprets how it is being said in their
            head. That interpretation can be misinterpreted. Email is misunderstood or misinterpreted because we do not
            make eye contact or read the expression. Another research that was done by Frohlich and Oppenheimer, on some
            consequences of email vs face to face communication in an experiment, it states that people do better when
            they are debating or explaining something complex face to face rather than emailing. &nbsp;However. When
            they try to explain something in detail or want to ask something they do better over email because email is
            able to wait for the person to complete their message and when an email is sent as a question it can wait
            until the person gets the chance to look and reply. This is important in the professional environment
            because a colleague or client can misunderstand the email and may think differently about the individual. As
            most people understand that first impression is important when getting doing a job interview. Recruiters
            usually look at many things other than answers for their question. They read body languages and look at the
            individual&#39;s behavior to get the first impression. Another big factor that is being used in modern days
            is when a person accepts and returns email after getting an interview date. Email is used on three occasions
            when an individual is trying to get a job. The first occasion is to accept the interview invitation, the
            second is after the interview, the individual may email back to say thank you and if an answer was not
            received from the interview, a follow-up email shows the interest. These also create the first impression
            for a person before getting the job.</span></p>
    <p><span>Email is a great way to communicate and it is also a great way to be anonymous and
            send bad messages to others. One of the early issues emails faced was bullying. Some were using email to
            blackmail or harass people. Emails can be created easily and people can create an email account with any
            name or word, this allows the user to be anonymous. Bullying over the internet is called cyberbullying.
            Cyberbullying is an international public health concern. Research shows that younger people often use
            communication systems such as email, facebook, and other social networks to bully other people. It has
            become one of the biggest issues in today&#39;s world. All social networks require an email address to sign
            up and the email address itself is also a way to send mean or private information that can impact a person.
            Over the years, many people were affected by cyberbullying. There have been many cases where people who are
            experiencing cyberbullying became emotionally distressed, had suicidal thoughts and even committed suicide.
            &nbsp;Cyberbullying also leads to violence. That is why email is a large part of this issue. Email is being
            used as a hub to create other accounts and also send personal private information or pictures anonymously.
            This event brought attention to many governments to create laws to protect people. While email is being used
            for bullying, others have a sole intention to trick people and take their money. Once emails have become
            popular, businesses started using them to send advertisements. Some businesses share those emails with
            others as part of their policy that many people don&#39;t read or take seriously. Scammers use those emails
            to send links that might say &ldquo;you won $1,000 gift card&rdquo; or other messages that sounds very good
            but suspicious. Many people fall for those scams and provide their information such as a credit card number.
            Address and name. Scammers use that information to steal money from that account. There are many other ways
            scammers use email to steal information, install a virus on the individual, or to spy on the individual over
            their own computer. A employee opened an email that states that a google document was shared and to open
            click on the link. Once he clicked on the link, his email was hacked and it was used to send other
            colleagues emails that could affect their device and email. These scams can lead to financial hardship on a
            person or an employee getting fired because he/she was not careful and lead to a security breach on the
            company&#39;s information.</span></p>
    <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email has become a large part of
            people&#39;s lives. Research shows that there are about 5.2 billion email accounts throughout the world.
            Emails have its advantages and disadvantages. It is able to bring people together or it could nearly destroy
            someone&#39;s life. It requires to be responsible when using it. As technology evolves, emails become better
            and convenient to use but it also allows scammers to take advantage of people. People all around the world
            can feel closer to each other because of a communication system like email exists. People do not feel lonely
            or isolated because they are able to communicate with friends and family from anywhere around the world. On
            the other hand, people email to harass or bully others. These type of actions lead to a large consequence.
            People commit suicide, go into depression, causes emotional distress, and violence. Email became important
            not only in our daily life at home but also at work. Getting is a job and making the best impression
            requires email communication today. Email became a big part of professional life as well. Therefore, this
            research shows that Email can be extremely helpful and useful but if the individual is not careful, it could
            lead to major consequences. </span></p>
