				<p>
					<m>Television</m> has shaped our society in several ways from it's early days. It provided a
					platform to
					racial minorities, gave voice to LGBTQ+ community, amplified women representation, and made many
					social norms acceptable into society. Not only that, television also helped spread message from one
					corner of the world to another, whether it was broadcasting 1969 moon landing that was watched by
					~600 million people or covering national/worldwide tragedies in real-time.
				</p>

				<m>Pros:</m>
				<ul>
					<li>Easy and cheap source of entertainment.</li>
					<li>Stay in tune with live world events.</li>
					<li>Offers educational program.</li>
					<li>Helps expand your knowledge.</li>
					<li>Smart TV's let you access social applications.</li>
					<li>Encourages communication between family members.</li>
					<li>Newspaper and radio in one.</li>
				</ul>

				<m>Cons:</m>
				<ul>
					<li>Violence, crime and sex are always depicted in shows.</li>
					<li>Can lead to waste of time.</li>
					<li>Communication can deteriorate and makes us antisocial.</li>
					<li>Depicts sterotypes that viewers can take serious.</li>
					<li>TV advertisement may influence unhealty behavior among minors.</li>
					<li>News coverage is often shallow and may lead to aggressive perspectives on social issues.</li>
					<li>Some smart TVs collect user data without their knowledge.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					<m>Future of Television:</m> As the technology progresses, televisions are turning slimmer in size
					and providing more options than a traditional television which only supports cable. Smart TVs are
					the
					future of television and will move towards providing support for applications that are present on
					smart phones and computer.
